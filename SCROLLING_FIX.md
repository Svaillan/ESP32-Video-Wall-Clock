# Scrolling Fix Applied âœ…

## What Was Fixed

The message was ending too early because it checked when the **left edge** of the text reached a certain position, instead of waiting for the **right edge** (last letter) to completely exit the screen.

## Before Fix

```cpp
// Ended too early - when left edge reached -(textWidth)
if (activeScrollX < -(int)textWidth) {
    // Message finished
}
```

## After Fix

```cpp
// Now waits until right edge (last letter) exits screen
if (activeScrollX + (int)textWidth < 0) {
    // Message finished - last letter is now off screen
}
```

## Logic Explanation

- **activeScrollX**: Position of the left edge of the text
- **textWidth**: Width of the entire message text
- **activeScrollX + textWidth**: Position of the right edge (last letter)

The message now continues scrolling until `activeScrollX + textWidth < 0`, which means the last letter has completely moved off the left side of the screen.

## Test Commands

### Upload Fixed Firmware

```bash
pio run -e esp32dev --target upload
```

### Test Scrolling Duration

```bash
# Short message
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.107/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Short","priority":"normal"}'

# Long message
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.107/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"This is a much longer message to test the scrolling","priority":"normal"}'
```

## Expected Behavior Now

1. Message starts from **right edge** of screen
1. Scrolls **left** at steady pace
1. Continues until **last letter** completely exits left side
1. Then returns to "waiting for message" screen
1. **No more premature ending!**

The message should now feel complete and natural, scrolling the full distance you expect.
