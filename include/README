# Include Directory

This directory is intended for project header files for the ESP32 LED Matrix Clock.

Currently, this project implements all functionality in a single `main.cpp` file for simplicity.

## Future Header Files

As the project grows, consider moving these components to separate header files:

- `effects.h` - Background effect definitions and functions
- `menu.h` - Menu system structures and handlers
- `colors.h` - Color definitions and utilities
- `rtc_manager.h` - Real-time clock functionality
- `button_handler.h` - Input processing and debouncing
- `display.h` - Matrix display utilities and text rendering

## Usage

Header files should be included in `src/main.cpp` using:

```cpp
#include "header_name.h"
```
