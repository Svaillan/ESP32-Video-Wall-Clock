# Include Directory

This directory is intended for project header files for the ESP32 LED Matrix Clock.

## Current Status

This project has been **refactored into a modular architecture** with separate libraries in the `lib/` directory. Each module has its own header and implementation files.

## Architecture Overview

The modular design includes these components:

### Core Libraries (in `lib/` directory)
- **`AppStateManager/`** - Centralized application state management
- **`ButtonManager/`** - Input handling with debouncing and repeat functionality
- **`ClockDisplay/`** - Time rendering, formatting, and display logic
- **`EffectsEngine/`** - Background animation system with particle effects
- **`MatrixDisplayManager/`** - Hardware abstraction layer for HUB75 interface
- **`MenuSystem/`** - Navigation, configuration, and user interface
- **`SettingsManager/`** - Persistent configuration storage with EEPROM

### Global Headers (if needed)
This directory can be used for:
- **`config.h`** - Global configuration constants and pin definitions
- **`types.h`** - Shared data structures and type definitions
- **`version.h`** - Project version information

## Benefits of Modular Architecture
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Each module has a single responsibility
- ✅ **Reusability** - Libraries can be used in other projects
- ✅ **Maintainability** - Easier to debug and extend functionality
- ✅ **Testing** - Individual modules can be unit tested
- ✅ **Collaboration** - Multiple developers can work on different modules

## Adding New Headers
Place global header files here if they need to be shared across multiple libraries.

Header files should be included in `src/main.cpp` using:

```cpp
#include "header_name.h"
```
